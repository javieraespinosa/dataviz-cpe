# Exploring a Household’ Energy Consumption and Temperature Patterns 

Although not as important as buildings, households' energy consumption contributes to the global carbon footprint. In this exercise, you will visually analyse the energy consumption and temperature patterns of a real household located in the north of France and report your findings.

# Dataset

The dataset is composed of approx. 1-year of measurements concerning:
* Electricity consumption (kWh)
* indoor/outdoor temperature (°C)
* indoor/outdoor relative humidity (%)

The household is in the Picardie region, is made of red brick, and is occupied by a retired person.

# To Do

Working in groups, try to answer the following questions using Altair (vega-lite) and http://rawgraphs.io. Compare and report. 

* Produce a line graph showing the electricity consumption over time. 
  * Do you observe any pattern?
  * Are there any outliers?
* Produce a heatmap showing energy consumption during different periods (e.g., per day, per hour).
  * At which moment of the day the energy consumption is more significant?
  * Do you observe any consumption patterns during the year? For instance, during holidays?
* Compare indoor and outdoor temperatures. 
  * Is the indoor temperature sensible to changes in external temperature?
  * Do you think the inhabitant should invest in improving the house isolation? 

# To Hand-in

* A notebook (or report) describing your findings. You should include your graphs and a description of your findings. You should also give details of the operations you applied to the data to produce the graphs.
* Produce a table summarizing the differences and similarities between Altair (Vega-Lite) and Rawgraphs.io. When would you use one tool over the other?
